The August Complex Fire was the <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/1a0a88e7872e48919831793fd496b814#:~:text=The%20largest%20wildfire%20in%20California%20history&text=Of%20those%20ignitions%2C%2037%20would,acre%20footprint%20across%20seven%20counties.">largest wildfire</a> in Californian history, covering over 1 million acres, an area larger than the state of Rhode Island.  Approximately 77,000 people evacuated to surrounding counties, which we will visualize here.  For this visualization, we utilized <a href="https://github.com/GeoDS/COVID19USFlows#code-usage">US mobility data</a> along with the California <a href="https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nifc::wfigs-interagency-fire-perimeters/explore?location=35.108013%2C-115.709586%2C5.92">wildfire</a> geolocation data. The 7 larger nodes marked in purple are the counties (Mendocino, Humbolt, Trinity, Tehama, Glenn, Lake, and Colusa) that were directly affected by the August complex fire, <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020/8/16/august-complex-includes-doe-fire/">according to CA fire</a>. In the graph, we show where people have migrated to from one county to another during the fire.
